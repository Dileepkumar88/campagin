Step 1:
Source Environment:		FinRec2
Target Environment:		Production
Cube/Mappings Names:	REP_Finance
•	FINAL – LOAD CUBE – LRATRAN – R Application
•	FINAL – LOAD CUBE – LRATRAN – S Application (Current)
•	FINAL – LOAD CUBE – LRATRAN – S Application (Arrears)
REP_Rates
•	LOAD CUBE – RATES – LRATRAN

Step 2:
Notes:
1.	The old transaction date mapping looks like this – YEAR(tra.trandate) * 10000 + MONTH(tra.trandate)* 100+ DAY(tra.trandate) As TransDate.

2.	And the new transaction date mapping -     IIF(stat.usercode IN ('DISC','FINA','FINC'),YEAR(tra.docstrdate) * 10000 + MONTH(tra.docstrdate)* 100+ DAY(tra.docstrdate),YEAR(tra.trandate) * 10000 + MONTH(tra.trandate)* 100+ DAY(tra.trandate)) As TransDate

Step 3:
Instruction:
Amend the old date mappings CAREFULLY to include a condition as highlighted in green in the following four (4) pages:
