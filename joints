Difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN	

An INNER JOIN is such type of join that returns all rows from both the participating tables where the key record of one table is equal to the key records of another table. This type of join required a comparison operator to match rows from the participating tables based on a common field or column of both the tables.																									
																									
Where as the OUTER JOIN returns all rows from the participating tables which satisfy the condition and also those rows which do not match the condition will appear in this operation. This result set can appear in three types of format -																									
																									
The first one is LEFT OUTER JOIN, in this join includes all the rows from a left table of JOIN clause and the unmatched rows from a right table with NULL values for selected columns.																									
																									
The second one is RIGHT OUTER JOIN, in this join includes all rows from the right of JOIN cause and the unmatched rows from the left table with NULL values for selected columns.																									
																									
The last one in FULL OUTER JOIN, in this join, includes the matching rows from the left and right tables of JOIN clause and the unmatched rows from left and right table with NULL values for selected columns.																									
																									
																									
																									
Difference between JOIN and INNER JOIN																									
JOIN returns all rows from tables where the key record of one table is equal to the key records of another table.																									
																									
The INNER JOIN selects all rows from both participating tables as long as there is a match between the columns. An SQL INNER JOIN is same as JOIN clause, combining rows from two or more tables.																									
																									
An inner join of A and B gives the result of A intersect B, i.e. the inner part of a Venn diagram intersection.																									
																									
Inner joins use a comparison operator to match rows from two tables based on the values in common columns from each table. For example, retrieving all rows where the student identification number is the same for both the students and courses tables.																									
																									
Using JOIN Clause																									
																									
SELECT * FROM																									
Table1 JOIN Table2																									
ON Table1.column_name=Table2.column_name;																									
Copy																									
Using INNER JOIN Clause																									
																									
SELECT *																									
FROM Table1 INNER JOIN Table2																									
ON Table1.column_name= Table2.column_name;																									
																									
																									
Example:																									
																									
Here is two table tableX and tableY and they have no duplicate rows in each. In tableX the values ( A,B) are unique and in tableY the values (E,F) are unique, but the values (C and D) are common in both the tables.																									
table X	table Y																								
A	C																								
B	D																								
C	E																								
D	F																								
																									
																									
Here is INNER JOIN																									
																									
SELECT *																									
FROM tableX																									
INNER JOIN tableY on tableX.X = tableY.Y;																									
Copy																									
or																									
																									
SELECT tableX.*,tableY.*																									
FROM tableX,tableY																									
WHERE tableX.X = tableY.Y;																									
Copy																									
Output:																									
																									
																									
Here only the matching of both tableX and tableY have appeared in the result set.																									
																									
Here is LEFT OUTER JOIN																									
																									
SELECT tableX.*,tableY.*																									
FROM tableX,tableY																									
WHERE tableX.X = tableY.Y(+)																									
Copy																									
or																									
																									
SELECT *																									
FROM tableX																									
LEFT OUTER JOIN tableY ON tableX.X= tableY.Y																									
																									
OUTPUT																									
X	Y																								
A	NULL																								
B	NULL																								
C	C																								
D	D																								
																									
Here all the rows from tableX that is left side of JOIN clause and all the rows with NULL values for unmatched columns from tableY that is the right side of JOIN clause have appeared.																									
																									
Here is RIGHT OUTER JOIN																									
																									
SELECT * FROM tableX																									
RIGHT OUTER JOIN tableY ON tableX.X= tableY.Y																									
																									
X	Y																								
C	C																								
D	D																								
NULL	E																								
NULL	F																								
																									
Here all the rows from tableY that is the right side of JOIN clause and all the rows with NULL values for unmatched columns from tableX that is left side of JOIN clause have appeared.																									
																									
																									
Here is FULL OUTER JOIN																									
																									
SELECT *																									
FROM tableX																									
FULL OUTER JOIN tableY ON tableX.X= tableY.Y																									
																									
X	Y																								
A	NULL																								
B	NULL																								
C	C																								
D	D																								
NULL	E																								
NULL	F																								
																									
Here all the matching rows from tableX and tableY and all the unmatched rows with NULL values for both the tables have appeared.																									
																									
																									
What is Natural Join in SQL?																									
We have already learned that an EQUI JOIN performs a JOIN against equality or matching column(s) values of the associated tables and an equal sign (=) is used as comparison operator in the where clause to refer equality.																									
																									
The SQL NATURAL JOIN is a type of EQUI JOIN and is structured in such a way that, columns with the same name of associated tables will appear once only.																									
																									
Natural Join: Guidelines																									
																									
- The associated tables have one or more pairs of identically named columns.																									
- The columns must be the same data type.																									
- Don’t use ON clause in a natural join																									
																									
Syntax:																									
																									
SELECT *																									
FROM table1																									
NATURAL JOIN table2;																									
																									
What is Cross Join in SQL?																									
The SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if no WHERE clause is used along with CROSS JOIN.This kind of result is called as Cartesian Product.																									
																									
If WHERE clause is used with CROSS JOIN, it functions like an INNER JOIN.																									
																									
An alternative way of achieving the same result is to use column names separated by commas after SELECT and mentioning the table names involved, after a FROM clause.																									
																									
Syntax:																									
																									
SELECT *																									
FROM table1																									
CROSS JOIN table2;

OUTER JOIN																									
The SQL OUTER JOIN returns all rows from both the participating tables which satisfy the join condition along with rows which do not satisfy the join condition. The SQL OUTER JOIN operator (+) is used only on one side of the join condition only.
